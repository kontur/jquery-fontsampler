#Wishlist

* in input editor vs linked separate input field

Partially done:
* Possibility to instantiate with data attributes on the element
* OpenType feature activation (language specific, other features)
* single line vs paragraph previews

Out of scope:
* webfont obfuscation / character subsets (?)
* wordpress plugin with font file upload and manager
* customizable styling
* customizable layout
* shorthands for changing the text sample (default options)
